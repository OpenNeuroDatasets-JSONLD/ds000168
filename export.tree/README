Offline Processing in Associative Learning

This is structural and functional MRI data from 35 healthy volunteers that accompanies 
Bursley et al. (2015), "Awake, Offline Processing During Associative Learning." Subjects 
encoded paired associates and then performed a distractor task before being probed on 
associate pairs. Pattern analyses suggest that encoded memories were reactivated during 
the distractor task, and performance of the distractor task led to superior recall for 
the associate pairs, compared to a control condition in which no distractor task was 
performed.
